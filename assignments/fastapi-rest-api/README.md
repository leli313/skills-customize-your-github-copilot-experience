# 🚀 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ FastAPI Setup

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI project and run a basic server.

#### Requirements
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., `main.py`)
- Start the server and verify it runs

### 🛠️ Create API Endpoints

#### Description
Implement RESTful endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., books, users, or tasks).

#### Requirements
- Create GET, POST, and DELETE endpoints
- Accept and return JSON data
- Validate input using Pydantic models

### 🛠️ Test Your API

#### Description
Test your endpoints using an API client (e.g., curl, Postman, or httpx).

#### Requirements
- Demonstrate successful requests and responses
- Handle errors gracefully
